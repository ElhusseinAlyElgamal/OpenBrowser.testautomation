# OpenBrowser Project

This project uses Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber to automate browser interactions and run tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. It includes necessary dependencies and configurations for Selenium WebDriver, TestNG testing framework, and Cucumber for BDD-style tests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Java 23 or above
- Maven 3.x or above
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional, but recommended)

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenBrowser.git
cd OpenBrowser
```

### Install Dependencies

Ensure Maven is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
mvn install
```

### Running Tests

This project uses TestNG and Cucumber for running automated tests. You can run the tests via the command line using Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key components in the project:

- **Selenium**: Automates web browser interactions for testing purposes.
- **TestNG**: Provides the framework to organize and execute tests.
- **Cucumber**: Supports behavior-driven development (BDD), which allows tests to be written in a human-readable format.
- **ExtentReports**: Generates detailed test reports, integrated with Cucumber for visual representation.

### Dependencies

The `pom.xml` file in this project includes the following key dependencies:

1. **Selenium**: Version `4.27.0` for automating web browser actions.
2. **TestNG**: Version `7.10.2` for organizing and executing tests.
3. **Cucumber**: Version `7.20.1` for behavior-driven development.
4. **ExtentReports**: Version `1.14.0` for generating detailed test reports with Cucumber.

### Configuration

- **Maven Compiler Plugin**: Configured for Java 23 (`maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` are set to 23).
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: The source encoding is set to UTF-8 for all files in the project.

## Running with Cucumber and TestNG

To run the Cucumber tests integrated with TestNG, you can use the following command:

```bash
mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @smoke"
```

This command will run all tests that are tagged as `@smoke`.

### Example Feature File

Create your Cucumber feature files under the `src/test/resources` directory. Example:

```gherkin
Feature: Open browser and perform actions

  Scenario: Open a website and check the title
    Given I open the browser
    When I navigate to "https://www.example.com"
    Then the title should be "Example Domain"
```

### Example Step Definitions

Create the corresponding step definitions in the `src/test/java` directory. Example:

```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class StepDefinitions {

    @Given("I open the browser")
    public void i_open_the_browser() {
        // Selenium code to open the browser
    }

    @Then("the title should be {string}")
    public void the_title_should_be(String title) {
        // Assert the page title using Selenium WebDriver
        assertEquals("Example Domain", title);
    }
}
```

### ExtentReports

To generate detailed reports, the project uses `extentreports-cucumber7-adapter`. After running the tests, you can find the generated reports in the `target` directory.
